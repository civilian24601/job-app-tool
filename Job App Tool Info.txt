* Improvements: Adding search functionality within the sidebar can help users quickly find specific documents. Additionally, integrating a preview feature for documents (e.g., PDFs, images) would be very user-friendly.
3. Document Parsing and Storage
Feedback:
* Feasibility: Parsing documents using libraries like pdf-parse and mammoth is feasible and effective for extracting text from PDFs and DOCX files.
* Implementation: Ensure robust error handling during the parsing process. Store both the original binary data and the extracted text for each document.
* Improvements: Expand support for more document types and improve text extraction quality by integrating additional NLP tools if needed. Consider using a microservice architecture to handle document parsing if the application scales.
4. Unified Job Search with APIs
Feedback:
* Feasibility: Integrating job search APIs from platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Wellfound, and Indeed is feasible. Each platform provides APIs to fetch job listings.
* Implementation: Create a unified interface in your backend to interact with these APIs. Implement filters to allow users to customize their job search (e.g., location, job type, keywords).
* Improvements: Rate limiting and API quotas need to be managed to avoid hitting API usage limits. Consider caching job search results to improve performance and reduce API calls.
5. Job Listing Management
Feedback:
* Feasibility: Adding features to save, reject, or remove job listings is feasible. This requires maintaining a list of saved and rejected jobs for each user.
